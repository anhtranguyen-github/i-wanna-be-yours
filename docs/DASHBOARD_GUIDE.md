# 📊 Hanabira Strategic Dashboard Report

The **Study Plan Dashboard** is the "Command Center" of the Hanabira learning experience. It shifts the focus from simple task completion to high-level strategic mastery, integrating the **OKR**, **PACT**, and **SMART** frameworks with real-time learning data.

## 🏗️ 1. Main Navigation & Global Stats
The dashboard is organized into four distinct views, allowing users to switch between strategic planning and tactical execution.

### **Global Header Statistics**
*   **Days Remaining**: Countdown to the target JLPT exam date.
*   **Overall Progress**: A weighted aggregate of all active SMART goals and OKRs.
*   **Study Streak**: Current consecutive days of PACT commitment fulfillment.
*   **Vocab/Content Mastered**: Real-time count of items moved to "Mastered" status in the SRS system.

## 🏛️ 2. The STRATEGY Tab
*The "Why" and "How" of your learning journey.*

### **PACT Daily Card**
*   **Purpose**: A personal mission statement (e.g., "Become confident for a job in Tokyo").
*   **Streak & Streak Target**: Visualizes habit consistency using the "Flame" icon.
*   **Context Check-in**: A daily "Vibe Check" where users log mood and energy. This data influences the AI's priority recommendations for the day.
*   **Action List**: Non-negotiable daily habits (e.g., "15m SRS Review").

### **SMART Goal Cards**
*   **Framework Breakdown**: Cards explicitly show the Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound breakdown of a goal.
*   **Success Criteria**: A checklist of metrics (e.g., "90% Quiz Accuracy") that must be met to achieve the goal.
*   **AI Confidence**: An AI-calculated percentage of how likely you are to hit the deadline based on your current velocity.

### **OKR Objective Cards**
*   **Objectives**: Ambitious, high-level goals (e.g., "Internalize N3 Grammar").
*   **Key Results (KR)**: Quantifiable metrics linked to the objective.
*   **KR Details**: Expands to show **Velocity** (units learned/day) and **Projected Completion** dates based on current performance.

## ⚡ 3. The TASKS Tab
*The daily execution layer.*

### **Tactical Directives**
*   **Daily Task List**: A generated list of specific actions for the current day (e.g., "N3 Verb Quiz").
*   **Step-by-Step Status**: Simple toggle to mark tasks as "Captured" (completed).

### **Activity Records Vault**
*   **Live Feed**: A reverse-chronological log of every learning interaction (Quiz results, Flashcard sessions, Reading parser usage).
*   **Verification**: Shows the status of each activity and how it contributed to your broader goals.

---

## 🔍 4. The DIAGNOSTICS Tab
*The analytical layer identifying gaps and optimizing time.*

### **Priority Matrix Card**
*   **Skill Priorities**: Skills are color-coded:
    *   🔴 **Red (Deep Teaching)**: Critical gaps where accuracy is low.
    *   🟡 **Yellow (Drill Practice)**: Items needing solidification.
    *   🟢 **Green (Maintain)**: Mastered items requiring periodic review.
*   **Time Allocation**: A horizontal bar chart suggesting how many minutes you should spend in each "color zone" today for maximum efficiency.

### **Error Analysis**
*   **Knowledge Gaps**: Errors stemming from unknown material.
*   **Process Errors**: Errors where you know the material but applied it incorrectly.
*   **Careless Errors**: Errors attributed to low focus or speed.

---

## 📈 5. The PERFORMANCE Tab
*The retrospective view of growth.*

*   **Mastery Radar**: A spider chart showing your balance across the 5 JLPT pillars (Vocab, Grammar, Kanji, Reading, Listening).
*   **Retention Power**: A trend line showing how well you are retaining information over time versus the "Forgetting Curve."

## 🎯 Summary of Purpose
The dashboard's primary purpose is to **eliminate "Busy Work."** By connecting every quiz result to a Key Result, and every Key Result to an Objective, the student is always aware of **exactly why** they are studying a specific item and **how much further** they have to go to reach their JLPT target.
