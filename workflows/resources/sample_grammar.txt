Japanese Grammar: The TE-Form (て形)

The te-form (te-kei) is one of the most useful verb forms in Japanese. It doesn't have a single translation but is used to connect sentences, make requests, and form other grammatical structures.

1. Group 1 verbs (u-verbs):
- u, tsu, ru -> tte (e.g., au -> atte, matsu -> matte)
- mu, bu, nu -> nde (e.g., yomu -> yonde, asobu -> asonde)
- ku -> ite (e.g., kaku -> kaite) *Exception: iku -> itte
- gu -> ide (e.g., oyogu -> oyoide)
- su -> shite (e.g., hanasu -> hanashite)

2. Group 2 verbs (ru-verbs):
- Replace 'ru' with 'te' (e.g., taberu -> tabete, miru -> mite)

3. Irregular verbs:
- suru -> shite
- kuru -> kite

Usage:
- Request: "Matte kudasai" (Please wait)
- Progressive: "Tabete imasu" (I am eating)
- Connection: "Asa okite, koohii o nomimashita" (I woke up and drank coffee)
