# Master Plan: Item Detail Enhancement Suite

## Overview
This master plan tracks the implementation of high-fidelity "Detail Pages" across three core modules: Quoot, Practice, and Flashcards. The goal is to move from a "Direct Play" model to an "Inform & Play" model, providing users and guests with valuable insights before they commit to a session.

## Sub-Plans
- [ ] **Quoot Deck Details**: [quoot_details_plan.md](./quoot_details_plan.md) (Arcade Theme)
- [ ] **Practice Set Details**: [practice_details_plan.md](./practice_details_plan.md) (Laboratory Theme)
- [ ] **Flashcard Deck Details**: [flashcards_details_plan.md](./flashcards_details_plan.md) (Zen Library Theme)

## Global Dependencies
- Shared "Share ID" component with clipboard API.
- Reusable "Stat Card" and "Activity Timeline" base components.
- Standardized owner check logic for the "Edit" action.
- Unified Record tracking service integration.
